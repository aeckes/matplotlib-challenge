Observations:

1) The drug Capomulin appears to reduce the size of tumors over the course of the treatment, performing better than Infubinol, Ketapril and a Placebo. 

2) Capomulin and Infubinol seem to slow the metastatic spread, but Infubinol also appears to have a higher mortality rate than all the other drugs tested, including a placebo. Capomulin has the lowest mortality rate.

3) From this simple analysis, it appears that Capomulin is the best drug to use to slow metastatic spread, reduce tumor volume, and has the highest survival rate, on average.

4) Standard errors are not visible in my charts, and looking at the data, they do appear to be very small.  When I use a different marker, I can hardly see the range.

I need more time to finish the last bar chart and will do so by Tuesday evening 10/15
